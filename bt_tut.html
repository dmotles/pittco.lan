<h2>This guide ripped off from demonoid.me. Please keep that in mind if you are following this guide.</h2>
<h1>NOTE: With only a few peers download speeds will probably seem slow on lan. Bit Torrent is optimized for mass numbers of people downloading the same file on the internet. Most files on LAN do not have this level of demand. Pittco staff recommends you use the torrent feature if you have a gigantic collection of something and you don't want your gaming rig to be crushed by 20 people trying to download off of you. It is recommended that you talk to a staff member about using webseeding PRIOR to creating your .torrent file to improve the distribution speed of your file.</h1>

This is a step by step guide on how to create and upload a torrent to <del>Demonoid.me</del> torrents.pittco.lan, using uTorrent.<br> 
To get uTorrent, please visit <del>their site</del> files.pittco.lan at <a href="http://files.pittco.lan/software/uTorrent/" target="_blank">files.pittco.lan</a>.<br> 
<ol> 
<li><del>Log into your Demonoid account</del> Visit <a href="http://torrents.pittco.lan">torrents.pittco.lan</a> and click on the "upload a torrent" link. It is located in the upper left hand corner under "Torrents". You will be presented with the torrent upload rules. <i>Please read them!</i><br> 
<br></li>

<br> 
<br></li> 
<li>Click on "Add directory" and select the directory you created before<br> 
On the "Trackers:" field, add the tracker starting with <b>http</b> from the tracker list presented to you on the torrent upload page (uTorrent does not support UDP trackers at the time of writing this tutorial). For pittco is should be <u>http://torrents.pittco.lan/announce.php</u><br> 
On the "Comment" field, add a comment about your torrent (optional)<br> 
Check the "Start seeding" field<br>

<br> 
<br></li> 
<li>Click on "Create and save as", and save the torrent somewhere in your computer where you can get to it to upload it to the tracker. Then click on "Close"<br> 
<br></li> 
<li>The torrent will appear on uTorrent's list. If the torrent is stopped, right click on it and select "Force start" from the menu.<br> 
<br> 
<img src="/images/tutorials/faq_creation_utorrent_9a.gif" width="363" height="152" alt=""><br> 
<br> 
You will get an error message that reads "Failure: torrent deleted or not in pool yet", because we have not uploaded the torrent to <del>Demonoid</del> torrents.pittco.lan yet. Ignore it for now.<br> 
<br> 
<img src="/images/tutorials/faq_creation_utorrent_9b.gif" width="416" height="370" alt=""><br> 
 
<br> 
<br></li> 
<li>Return to <del>Demonoid</del> torrents.pittco.lan, and on the "Torrent file" field, click on the "browse" button. Select the .torrent file you created in uTorrent.
<br> 
<br></li> 
<li>Add a name and a description. the description must be at least 30 characters long. Please keep in mind that the better the information that you provide in your description, the more likely it is that people will download it. Then click on the "Finish upload" button.<br> 
If everything is correct, you'll be redirected to the details page of your newly uploaded torrent.<br> 
<br></li> 
<li>Now, we wait 3 minutes to give time to the tracker to add the torrent to it's pool. After waiting 3 minutes, go to uTorrent, right click on the torrent you just created, and select "Update tracker" from the menu. If you waited long enough, you should get "Tracker status: Working" instead of the error from earlier<br>

</li> 
<li>We are done! Now we just leave uTorrent seeding the file for a few hours so some people have the chance to download the files.<br>
